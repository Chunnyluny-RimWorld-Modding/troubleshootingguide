I wanted to make a guide or document for people who are trying to figure out how to make their modded game work or want to play modded RimWorld. To whom is this document
useful? For newcomers who want to play modded RimWorld. But also for people that are playing with mods and have issues troubleshooting why their game isn’t working.

You can read about my experience with mods. And if you are curious, you can learn about making your first own RimWorld mod. There is a RimWorld wiki page about modding, but I try to contribute where I can. Some information I have gathered from the RimWorld discord server.

Useful links are shared at the end of this document. Links are displayed as hyperlinks, if you right-click the link you can open it in a new browser tab. This is an easy and quick way to access the information. You can click on headers in the table of contents, so you will jump to that part directly.

*Disclaimer: I recommend that when you read this document, you take everything with a grain of salt. Most people do not even read mod descriptions, so I do not expect you to read this entire guide and understand it right away.*

All of this knowledge was gathered through experience and help from RimWorld's discord server's troubleshooters. If you have any suggestions or believe I should rewrite a section, please let me know by posting a reaction on the specific part. This can be a rephrasing, additional information, or another suggestion.

I dedicated my spare time to this project, so people can find detailed information on one central spot. I hope you can use this guide to troubleshoot your issues in your modded game.
My goal is to teach you about issues that have been presented in troubleshooting posts, which will prevent you from making the same mistakes as the people before you. Use caution when interpreting anything. If not convinced, just do your own research.
You can use this guide to decide whether to add or remove particular mods. If you don’t need to learn about that, you can read about external mod managers. If you are interested, you can also learn to make your own RimWorld mod and publish it.
