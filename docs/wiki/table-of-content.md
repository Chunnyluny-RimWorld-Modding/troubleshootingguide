I choose to not publish it; the published page messed up my formatting. I prefer to share the document in its edit state, you can see when I actively work on it. It also makes it possible to give active feedback. I have tried to publish the Google document, but it didn't render the pages and the images correctly.

### Specifications 

- Date of creation, 23-01-2023
