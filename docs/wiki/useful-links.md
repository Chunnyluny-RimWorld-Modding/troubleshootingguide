In this part, I want to list useful links that are worth looking at, some are discord servers that are great communities and where RimWorld is an active topic. I wanted to make it as clear as possible to find the link you are looking for, so I have put the links in different categories by separating them using horizontal line dividers. If you have found a link that is not in this list, please let me know, so I can add it to the list.
